## Introduction to S-58

IHO S-58 was previously Appendix B.1, Annex C of S-57 Edition 3.1. It specifies the minimum checks that
producers of ENC validation tools should include in their validation software. This software must be used by
hydrographic offices to help ensure that their ENC data are compliant with the S-57, Appendix B.1 ENC Product
Specification. The S-58 checklist has been compiled for the IHO from lists of checks provided by a number of hydrographic
offices and software companies.
